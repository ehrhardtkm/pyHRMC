# Welcome to pyHRMC

pyHRMC is a tool designed to aid users in perform Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo simulations from electron-based scattering. Some key features of the package include:

1. Flexible modeling capabilities, including simulation of slab structures
2. Accurate scattering cross sections for electron scattering
3. Machine-learned potentials to predict structural energies with high accuracy 
4. Highly parallelizable architecture for major speedups
