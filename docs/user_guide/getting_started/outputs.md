Once the HRMC simulation is started, pyHRMC will generate several files that it will continuously update during the simulation. 

These files contain data regarding the simulation and can be used for post-processing:

error_plotting.txt

output.vasp

XDATCAR

Additionally, several files are created and used by HRMC during the simulation, but do not provide useful information ot the user:

{int}.lmp

last_step.txt

out4.txt
