    """
    Compute the partial radial distribution function (PRDF) of an xtal structure

    The PRDF of a crystal structure is the radial distribution function broken
    down for each pair of atom types.  The PRDF was proposed as a structural
    descriptor by [Schutt *et al.*]
    (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.205118)

    Args:
        cutoff: (float) distance up to which to calculate the RDF.
        bin_size: (float) size of each bin of the (discrete) RDF.
        include_elems: (list of string), list of elements that must be included in PRDF
        exclude_elems: (list of string), list of elements that should not be included in PRDF

    Features:
        Each feature corresponds to the density of number of bonds
        for a certain pair of elements at a certain range of
        distances. For example, "Al-Al PRDF r=1.00-1.50" corresponds
        to the density of Al-Al bonds between 1 and 1.5 distance units
        By default, this featurizer generates RDFs for each pair
        of elements in the training set.
